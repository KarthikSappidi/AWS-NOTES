# CLOUD COMPUTING
- The Cloudâ€™ can also refer to Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform (AWS/AZURE/GCP/Oracle etc) via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

# PUBLIC CLOUD VS PRIVATE CLOUD
- **Public Cloud**:The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by third-party providers(AWS,AZURE,GCP) over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free or sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume.
- **Private Cloud**:A private cloud is a cloud computing environment dedicated to a single organization. Any cloud infrastructure has underlying compute resources like CPU and storage that you provision on demand through a self-service portal. In a private cloud, all resources are isolated and in the control of one organization. So, the private cloud is also called the internal or corporate cloud.

# DATA CENTER
- A data center is a building, a dedicated space within a building, or a group of buildings used to house computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems.
- A modern data center concentrates an organization's data systems in a well-protected physical infrastructure, including:
servers;
storage systems;
Networking components like switches, routers and firewalls;
cabling; and
physical racks to organise and interconnect IT equipment.

# SERVER INFRASTRUCTURE
- Server infrastructure consists of physical and virtual resources, along with hardware, software, network resources, to support the management of servers in an IT environment. A server is a computer system built to share its resources, such as data, services, and programs, locally and over a network.

# AWS SECURITY
- AWS provides services that help you protect your data, accounts, and workloads from unauthorized access. AWS data protection services provide encryption capabilities, key management, and sensitive data discovery to help you protect your data and workloads.

# AWS HIGH AVAILABILITY
- High availability means that an IT system, component, or application can operate at a high level, continuously, without intervention, for a given time period. High-availability infrastructure is configured to deliver quality performance and handle different loads and failures with minimal or zero downtime.

# AWS FAULT TOLERANCE
- Fault Tolerance simply means a system's ability to continue operating uninterrupted despite the failure of one or more of its components. This is true whether it is a computer system, a cloud cluster, a network, or something else.

# AWS SCALABILITY
- Scalability refers to the ability of your connectivity solution to grow and evolve over time as your requirements change.
