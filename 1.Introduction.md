# CLOUD COMPUTING
- The Cloudâ€™ can also refer to Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform (AWS/AZURE/GCP/Oracle etc) via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

# PUBLIC CLOUD VS PRIVATE CLOUD
- **Public Cloud**:The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by third-party providers(AWS,AZURE,GCP) over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free or sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume.
- **Private Cloud**:A private cloud is a cloud computing environment dedicated to a single organization. Any cloud infrastructure has underlying compute resources like CPU and storage that you provision on demand through a self-service portal. In a private cloud, all resources are isolated and in the control of one organization. So, the private cloud is also called the internal or corporate cloud.
