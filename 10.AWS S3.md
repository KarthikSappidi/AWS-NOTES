## Amazon S3
- Simple Storage Service is a scalable and secure cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.
- S3 has the characteristics of scalability, High Availability, security, cost effective and productivity.

## S3 Buckets
- S3 buckets are containers for storing objects (files) in Amazon S3. Each bucket has a unique name globally across all of AWS. You can think of an S3 bucket as a top-level folder that holds your data.

## Use of S3 Buckets
- S3 buckets provide a reliable and highly scalable storage solution for various use cases. They are commonly used for backup and restore, data archiving, content storage for websites, and as a data source for big data analytics.

## Benefits of S3 Buckets
- S3 buckets offers several advantages including
```bash
Durability and availability: S3 provides high durability and availability for your data.
Scalability: You can store and retrieve any amount of data without worrying about capacity constraints.
Security: S3 offers multiple security features such as encryption, access control, and audit logging.
Performance: S3 is designed to deliver high performance for data retrieval and storage operations.
Cost-effective: S3 offers cost-effective storage options and pricing models based on your usage patterns.
```
## Creating and Configuring S3 Buckets
- Creating an S3 bucket
- To create an S3 bucket, you can use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI (Command Line Interface), or AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits). You need to specify a globally unique bucket name and select the region where you want to create the bucket.
- Choosing a bucket name and region
- The bucket name must be unique across all existing bucket names in Amazon S3. It should follow DNS naming conventions, be 3-63 characters long, and contain only lowercase letters, numbers, periods, and hyphens. The region selection affects data latency and compliance with specific regulations.
- Bucket properties and configurations
**Versioning**: Versioning allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in the bucket. It helps protect against accidental deletions or overwrites.
  - S3 versioning is a feature to manage and store versions of an object
- S3 versioning protects your data against accidental overrides and deletion.
- By default, versioning is disabled on all buckets.
- Versioning can only be set on the bucket level and applies to ALL objects in the bucket.

**Bucket Level Permisssions and Policies**: Bucket-level permissions and policies define who can access and perform actions on the bucket. You can grant permissions using IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies, which allow fine-grained control over user access to the bucket and its objects.

## Uploading and Managing Objects in S3 buckets

**Uploading objects to S3 buckets**: You can upload objects to an S3 bucket using various methods, including the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, SDKs, and direct HTTP uploads. Each object is assigned a unique key (name) within the bucket to retrieve it later.

**Object metadata and properties**: Object metadata contains additional information abouteach object in an S3 bucket. It includes attributes like content type, cache control, encryption settings, and custom metadata. These properties help in managing and organizing objects within the bucket.

**File Formats and objects encryption**:S3 supports various file formats, including text files, images, videos, and more. You can encrypt objects stored in S3 using server-side encryption (SSE). SSE options include SSE-S3 (Amazon-managed keys), SSE-KMS (AWS Key Management Service), and SSE-C (customer-provided keys).

**Life Cycle Management**: Lifecycle management allows you to define rules for transitioning objects between different storage classes or deleting them automatically based on predefined criteria. For example, you can move infrequently accessed data to a lower-cost storage class after a specified time or delete objects after a certain retention period.

 - Manage Data retention policy 
- An object lifecycle policy is a set of rules that automate the transitioning of an object's storage class to a different storage class (or deletion) based on specified time intervals.
- By default, lifecycle policies are disabled on a bucket.
- Great for automating the management of object storage and to be more cost effective.

## S3 Web Hosting
- You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website.
- Amazon S3 provides an option for low-cost, highly reliable web hosting service for static websites 
- By default web hosting is disabled
