## Simple Notification Service(SNS)
- Simple Notification Service is an integrated notification service provided by AWS that allows for the sending of messages to various endpoints.
- SNS coordinates and manages the sending and delivery of messages to specific endpoints.
- We are able to use SNS to receive notification when events occur in our AWS Environments.
- SNS is integrated into many AWS services, so it is very easy to set up notifications based on events that occur in those services.
- With CloudWatch and SNS, a full-environment monitoring solution can be created that notifies administrators

## SNS Components
- **Topic**: The group of subscriptions that you send a message to.
- **Subscription**: An endpoint that a message is sent. Available endpoints include:
- HTTP
- HTTPS
- Email
- Email-JSON
- SQS
- Application, Mobile APP notifications (IOS/Android/Amazon/Microsoft)
- SMS (Cellular text message)
- **Publisher**: The "entity" that triggers the sending of a message
               - Example include:Human,S3 Event,CloudWatch Alarm.


## Monitoring Services

**CloudWatch**: Cloudwatch is an AWS integrated monitoring service.
- Cloudwatch allows for comprehensive monitoring of all AWS provisioned resources with the ability to trigger alarms based off metric thresholds.
- Cloudwatch is used to monitor AWS services such as EC2, ELB and S3.
- Metrics are specific to each AWS service or resource, and include such metrics as: CPU Utilization,Number Of Objects,Unhealthy Host Count

## Monitoring Levels: Detailed Vs Basic level monitoring:
**Detailed**: Data is available in 1 minute period
**Basic**: Data is available automatically in 5 minute periods at no charge

- Cloud Watch Alarms can be created to trigger alerts ( or other actions in your AWS accounts, such as an SNS topic), based on the threshold you set on Cloudwatch metrics.
- **Auto Scaling** heavily utilizes CloudWatch - relying on threshold and alarms to trigger the addition (or removal) of instances from an auto scaling group.

## Cloud Watch Alarms
- One nice thing is, we can set up Cloudwatch Alarms, which can trigger events to SNS which in turn will send notifications to users.
- CloudWatch Alarms allow for you (or the system admin) to be notified when certain defined thresholds are met on Cloudwatch Metrics.
- For Example, you can setup an alarm to be triggered whenever the CPU Utilization metric on an EC2 instance goes above 70%
- Alarms can also be used to trigger other events in AWS like publishing to an SNS topic or triggering auto scaling.
- **System Status Checks** : (things that are outside of our control)
-Loss of network connectivity
-Loss of system power
-Software issues on the physical host
-Hardware issues on the physical host.

-**How to Resolve**: Generally stopping and restarting the instances will fix the issue. This causes the instance to launch on a different physical hardware device.

-**Instance Status Checks** : (software issues that we do control)
-Failed system status checks
-Misconfigured networking or startup configuration
-Exhausted memory
-Corrupted file system
-Incompatible kernel

**How to Resolve** : Generally a reboot or solving the file system configuration issue.


**Initiating Stress on the Instance(server)**

> sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
> sudo yum install stress -y
> stress --cpu 1 --timeout 10000 &
