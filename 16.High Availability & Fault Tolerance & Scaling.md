## AWS EC2 Auto Scaling
- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps maintain the availability opf your applications.
- Auto Scaling is the collection of EC2 instances that enabales auto matic scaling and fleet management features.These feature help you maintain the health and availability of your applications.

## High Availability
- For a solutions architect this means making sure your application (hosted in AWS) is always available when a user/customer tries to access it.
- For achieving High Availability, make sure your VPC is designed in such a way that at least two availability zones should be used to spread your Application.
- Also use an Elastic Load Balancer to direct the traffic to healthy servers which are part of different availability zones.

## Load Balancing
- Load balancing (as a concept) is a common method used for distributing incoming traffic among servers.
- An Elastic Load Balancer is an EC2 service that automates the process of distributing incoming traffic (evenly) to all the instances that are associated with the ELB.
- An elastic load balancer can load balance traffic to multiple EC2 instances located across multiple availability zones.

- An ELB has its own DNS record set that allows for direct access from the open internet access.
- ELB's will automatically stop serving traffic to an instance that becomes unhealthy (via health checks).

- An ELB improves the distribution of workloads across multiple servers ensuring that no one server is overworked, which could degrade performance.
- Elastic load balancing should be paired with auto scaling to enhance high availability and fault tolerance.
- Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool
- A Load balancer acts as the “traffic cop” sitting in front of your servers and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests
- Load balancing improves the distribution of workloads across multiple servers ensuring that no one server is overworked, which could degrade performance.
- If a single server goes down in server pool, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining online servers
- In load balancing, say you have a high traffic website which  gets 1000 requests per second may be more than that, if you have only one server all the 1000 requests will be severe by the single server where the response time will be decreased.
- So we put more servers and distribute the load to all the servers equally.
- So the 1000 requests will be distributed to 3 servers like 300 requests for each server assuming we got 3.
-  **Every server has limitation of resources, say this server has 8GB and 2 CPU's now it can serve services for 100 clients**

- **But if more then 100 clients come then this server cannot handle those extra requests and becomes slow or unstable**

- **Now imagine your server got huge traffic may be due to promotional offers**

- **Now the server is overburden, so you will deploy more servers and distribute the traffic evenly between them, now this thing is a manual task and manual things are BIG NO in IT world, So AWS has provided a service Auto Scaling to do this kind of activities automatically**

- **What Auto Scaling does is, it analyzes the load coming in and deploys the new servers to meet that demand, say around 300 people are coming in then, it will spin up new servers and set the application for us automatically.**

- **Now we need to have the exact configuration of server 1 to be replicated across server 2 and server 3 as well.**

- **So what happens is in Auto Scaling Service is, you will attach your AMI, and using that AMI it deploys more servers.**

- **Auto Scaling is service (and method) provided by AWS that automates the process of increasing or decreasing the instances on-demand for your application.**

- **Auto Scaling will increase or decrease the amount of instances based on chosen Cloudwatch metrics.**

- **For example: if your application's demand increases unexpectedly, auto scaling can automatically scale up (add instance) to meet the demand and terminate instances when the demand decreases. This is known as ELASTICITY in AWS environment**
