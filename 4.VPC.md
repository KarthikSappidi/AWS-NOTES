## VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD (VPC)
- Imagine you want to set up a private, secure, and isolated area in the cloud where you can run your applications and store your data. This is where a VPC comes into play.
- A VPC is a virtual network that you create in the cloud. It allows you to have your own private section of the internet, just like having your own network within a larger network. Within this VPC, you can create and manage various resources, such as servers, databases, and storage.
- Think of it as having your own little "internet" within the bigger internet. This virtual network is completely isolated from other users' networks, so your data and applications are secure and protected.
- Just like a physical network, a VPC has its own set of rules and configurations. You can define the IP address range for your VPC and create smaller subnetworks within it called subnets. These subnets help you organize your resources and control how they communicate with each other.
- To connect your VPC to the internet or other networks, you can set up gateways or routers. These act as entry and exit points for traffic going in and out of your VPC. You can control the flow of traffic and set up security measures to protect your resources from unauthorized access.
- With a VPC, you have control over your network environment. You can define access rules, set up firewalls, and configure security groups to regulate who can access your resources and how they can communicate.

 **To enable access to or from the internet to an instance in a VPC subnet, you must attach an Internet gateway to your VPC, ensure that your subnet route table points to the Internet gateway and ensure that instance has a public IP address, and ensure that your network access control and security group rules allow the relevant traffic to your instance" -- AWS**

## VPC Components

**Virtual Private Cloud**: A VPC is a virtual network that closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center. After you create a VPC, you can add subnets.

**Subnets**: A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. A subnet must reside in a single Availability Zone. After you add subnets, you can deploy AWS resources in your VPC.Each subnet is allocated with one IP addresses.

- When you create a VPC, it spans across all of the Availability Zones in the region. 
- After creating a VPC, you can add one or more subnets in each Availability zone.
- Each subnet must reside entirely within one availability zone and cannot span zones
- Subnets MUST be associated with a route table.
- A **PUBLIC** subnet HAS a route to the internet.
  (It is associated with a route table that has an IGW attached.)
- A **PRIVATE** subnet does NOT have a route to the Internet.
  (It is associated with a route table that does NOT have an IGW attached.)
  
**Internet Gateway**: Internet Gateway rules and details:
- Only 1 IGW can be attached to a VPC at a time.
- An IGW must be attached to a VPC if the resources inside the VPC need to connect to resources via the open internet.

**Route Table**: Use route tables to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.

- A route table contains a set of rules called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.
- Your VPC automatically comes with a main route table
- You can create additional custom route tables for your VPC.
- Each subnet must be associated with a route table, which controls the routing for the subnet. 
- If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a particular route table, the subnet is implicitly associated with the main route table.
- You cannot delete the main route table
- A route table's rules are comprised of two main components:
**Destination**: The CIDR block range of the target (where the data is routed to).
**Target**: A name identifier of where the data is being routed to.

- By default, all subnets traffic is allowed to each other, available subnet within your VPC which is called the local route.
- You cannot modify or delete the local route.
- Unlike an IGW, you can have multiple route tables in a VPC
- NOTE: The "default" VPC already has a "main" route table.

**Main / Default Route Table**: When you create a VPC, it automatically has a main route table. On the Route Tables page you can view the main route table for a VPC by looking for Yes in the Main column.
- The main route table controls the routing for all subnets that are not explicitly associated with any other route table. 

**Custom Route Table**: Your VPC can have route tables other than the default table.
- Custom route tables ensure that you explicitly control how each subnet routes outbound traffic.

**Network Access Control List**: A Network access control list (NACL) acts as a firewall for controlling traffic on one or more subnets. NACL's operate at the subnet level.
- They support allow and deny rules for traffic traveling into or out of a subnet.
- They are Stateless, so return traffic must be allowed through an outbound rule.
- They process rules in number order when deciding whether to allow traffic.
- Rules are evaluated in order,  starting with the lowest rule number - 
- for Example: if traffic is denied at a lower rule number and allowed at a higher rule number, the allow rule will be ignored and the traffic will be denied.
- NOTE - Your "default" VPC already has a NACL and it is associated with the default subnets.
  **Default NACL**:The default network ACL is configured to allow all traffic to flow in and out of the subnets to which it is associated.
    - Each network ACL also includes a rule whose rule number is an asterisk. This rule ensures that if a packet doesn't match any of the other numbered rules, it's denied. You can't        modify or remove this rule.
    - The following is an example default network ACL for a VPC

**NACL Rules**: Rules are evaluated from lowest to highest based on "rule #".
- The first rule found that applies to the traffic type is immediately applied, regardless of any rules that come after it
- An NACL allows or denies traffic from entering a subnet. Once inside the subnet, other AWS resources (i.e EC2 instances) may have an additional layer of security (security groups).

**Security Groups**: A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- Security groups are very similar to NACLs, Security groups act at the instance level, whereas NACLs work at subnet level.
- You can specify only allow rules, but not deny rules.
- Security groups are stateful â€” so return traffic requests are allowed regardless of rules.
- Your VPC automatically comes with a default security group.
- Each EC2 instance that you launch in your VPC is automatically associated with the default security group if you don't specify a different security group when you launch the           instance.
- You can't delete default Security Group.
- Changes to Security Groups take effect immediately.
- Default SG, will have inbound rules allowing instances assigned the same SG to talk to one another and also all outbound traffic is allowed.
- Custom (non-default) SG will have no inbound rules, basically all inbound traffic is denied by default and all outbound traffic is allowed by default.
