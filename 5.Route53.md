## AWS Route53 
- Route53 on aws provides DNS(Domain Name System) as a service.
- Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. You can use Route 53 to perform three main functions in any combination: domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking.
 **Register domain names**:Your website needs a name, such as example.com. Route 53 lets you register a name for your website or web application, known as a domain name.
 **DNS Routing**:When a user opens a web browser and enters your domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) in the address bar, Route 53 helps connect the browser with your website or web application.
 **Checking Health of a Resource**:Route 53 sends automated requests over the internet to a resource, such as a web server, to verify that it's reachable, available, and functional. You also can choose to receive notifications when a resource becomes unavailable and choose to route internet traffic away from unhealthy resources.
- After you configure Amazon Route 53 to route your internet traffic to your resources, such as web servers or Amazon S3 buckets, here's what happens in just a few milliseconds when someone requests content for www.example.com:

- A user opens a web browser, enters www.example.com in the address bar, and presses Enter.
- The request for www.example.com is routed to a DNS resolver, which is typically managed by the user's internet service provider (ISP), such as a cable internet provider, a DSL broadband provider, or a corporate network.
- The DNS resolver for the ISP forwards the request for www.example.com to a DNS root name server.
- The DNS resolver forwards the request for www.example.com again, this time to one of the TLD name servers for .com domains. The name server for .com domains responds to the request with the names of the four Route 53 name servers that are associated with the example.com domain.
- The DNS resolver caches (stores) the four Route 53 name servers. The next time someone browses to example.com, the resolver skips steps 3 and 4 because it already has the name servers for example.com. The name servers are typically cached for two days.
- The DNS resolver chooses a Route 53 name server and forwards the request for www.example.com to that name server.
- The Route 53 name server looks in the example.com hosted zone for the www.example.com record, gets the associated value, such as the IP address for a web server, 192.0.2.44, and returns the IP address to the DNS resolver.
- The DNS resolver finally has the IP address that the user needs. The resolver returns that value to the web browser.
- The web browser sends a request for www.example.com to the IP address that it got from the DNS resolver. This is where your content is, for example, a web server running on an Amazon EC2 instance or an Amazon S3 bucket that's configured as a website endpoint.
- The web server or other resource at 192.0.2.44 returns the web page for www.example.com to the web browser, and the web browser displays the page.
