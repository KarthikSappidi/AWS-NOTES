## Custom VPC Requriement
Requirement
Requirement Given by TCS

	> TCS is going to setup the environment i.e servers on AWS, their clients are from XYZ (REGION) Location

	> They are gonna host Servers

	> These servers are grouped into two subnets each with 4k servers

	> First Subnet is for web servers, around 4k

	> Second Subnet is for database servers, around 4k

	> In the future, they might add more number of subnets i.e application servers subnets, load balancer subnet etc

	> The web servers needs to be communicated from internet


	> The database servers needs to be communicated only from Web Servers, but not from internet


	> Coming to security of Web Servers, they should have only 
		> SSH traffic enabled for administration from internet
		> HTTP traffic for clients from internet

	> Coming to security of Database Servers, they should have only SSH access from web servers
		> SSH traffic enabled from web servers only

## Subnetting

When you create a VPC, you must specify a CIDR block for the VPC.
The allowed block size is between a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses) and /28 netmask (16 IP addresses).
AWS recommends to create a CIDR with 10.0.0.0/16 for future purpose

A.B.C.D - 10.0.0.0 / An IP Add is 32 bit number - 4 octets - 1 octet = 8 bits
A.B.C.D - A.B Fixed and C.D is for you to use
10.0.0.0/16  
10.0. - Reserved 
0.0 - For you to use

**Total Bits - 32
Netmask - X [ 16 - 28 ]
Result = Total Bits - Netmask
Number Of Devices/IP’s = 2 ^ Result**

/16 → 16 → 2 ^ 16 = 65536
/17 → 15 → 2 ^ 15 = 32768
/18 → 14 → 2 ^ 14 = 16384
/19 → 13 → 2 ^ 13 = 8192
/20 → 12 → 2 ^ 12 = 4096
/21 → 11 → 2 ^ 11 = 2048
/22 → 10 → 2 ^ 10 = 1024
/23 → 9 → 2 ^ 9 = 512
/24 → 8 → 2 ^ 8 = 256
/25 → 7 → 2 ^ 7 = 128
/26 → 6 → 2 ^ 6 = 64
/27 → 5 → 2 ^ 5 = 32
/28 → 4 → 2 ^ 4 = 16

**The first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are not available for you to use, and cannot be assigned to an instance.
10.0.0.0: Network address.
10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS for Amazon DNS server.
10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.
10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address.**
