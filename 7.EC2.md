## Elastic Cloud Compute
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- Access reliable, scalable infrastructure on demand. Scale capacity within minutes with SLA commitment of 99.99% availability.
- Provide secure compute for your applications. Security is built into the foundation of Amazon EC2 with the AWS Nitro System.
- Optimize performance and cost with flexible options like AWS Graviton-based instances, Amazon EC2 Spot instances, and AWS Savings Plans.

## EC2 Use Cases
- Deliver secure, reliable, high-performance, and cost-effective compute infrastructure to meet demanding business needs.
- Access the on-demand infrastructure and capacity you need to run HPC applications faster and cost-effectively.
- Access environments in minutes, dynamically scale capacity as needed, and benefit from AWS’s pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Deliver the broadest choice of compute, networking (up to 400 Gbps), and storage services purpose-built to optimize price performance for ML projects.

## EC2 Types
**General Purpose**: General Purpose instances are designed to deliver a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. They are suitable for a wide range of applications, including web servers,small databases, development and test environments, and more.

**Compute Optimized**: Compute Optimized instances provide a higher ratio of compute power to memory. They excel in workloads that require high-performance processing such as batch processing,scientific modeling, gaming servers, and high-performance web servers.

**Memory Optimized**: Memory Optimized instances are designed to handle memory-intensive workloads. They are suitable for applications that require large amounts of memory, such as in-memory databases,real-time big data analytics, and high-performance computing.

**Storage Optimized**: Storage Optimized instances are optimized for applications that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets.They are ideal for tasks like data warehousing, log processing, and distributed file systems.

**Accelearted Computing**: Accelerated Computing Instances typically come with one or more types of accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs),Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), or custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs).These accelerators offload computationally intensive tasks from the main CPU, enabling faster and more efficient processing for specific workloads.

## IP Addresses Types
**Private Types**: All EC2 instances are automatically created with a PRIVATE IP address.
                - The private IP address is used for internal (inside the VPC) communication between instances.
                - You cannot communicate with private ip from outside VPC

**Public Type**: When creating an EC2 instance, you have the option to enable (or auto-assign) a public IP address.
                - A public IP address is required if you want the EC2 instance to have direct communication with resources across the open internet, i.e if you want to directly SSH into the instance or have it directly serve web traffic.

**Elastic IP**: An Elastic IP address is also a public ip address, which is static and  is  reachable from the internet.
                - Attaching an EIP to an instance will replace it's default public IP address for as long as it is attached.
                - To ensure efficient use of Elastic IP addresses, AWS imposes a small hourly charge if an Elastic IP address is not associated with a running instance

## AWS User Data
- Refers to a self-starting process i.e run set of commands without external input.
- With EC2, we can bootstrap the instance (during the creation process) with custom commands (such as installing software packages, running updates and configuring other various settings).

## AWS Meta Data
- Because your instance metadata is available from your running instance, you do not need to use the Amazon EC2 console or the AWS CLI. 
- This can be helpful when you're writing scripts to run from your instance. For example, you can access the local IP address of your instance from instance metadata to manage a connection to an external application.
