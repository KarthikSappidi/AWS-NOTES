## Elastic Block Storage(EBS)
- EBS volumes (Hard Drives For Servers) that are attached to an EC2 instance are exposed as storage volumes that persist independently from the life of the instance. 
- Amazon EBS is recommended when data must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence.
- EBS volumes are particularly well-suited for use as the primary storage for OS, Applications systems & databases.

## Root vs Additional Volumes
- Every EC2 instance must have a root volume, but Additional Volume is Optional.
- By default, EBS "root" volumes are set to be deleted when the instance is terminated. However, you can choose to have EBS volumes persist after termination.
- You can add additional EBS volumes to instance if needed.
- Any additional volume can be attached or detached from instance at any time.

## EBS Types
**https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html**

## Snapshot
```bash
df -h
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
sudo mkdir /add-vol
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /add-vol
```
- A Snapshot is an "backup" of EBS Volume.
- A Snapshot is not an active EBS Volume, so we cannot attach a snapshot to EC2 Instance.
- To restore a snapshot, we need to create Volumes from the Snapshot.
- Snapshots help you get data across Multiple Zones & Multiple Regions, increasing data durability.

## EBS Limitations
- Using EBS we cannot directly get the data across Multiple Availability Zones
- Using EBS we cannot connect to multiple instances at the same time
- With  EBS Volume, you can only Scale Up, no scaling down
- EBS Volumes can scale only up to TBâ€™s
