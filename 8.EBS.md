## Elastic Block Storage(EBS)
- EBS volumes (Hard Drives For Servers) that are attached to an EC2 instance are exposed as storage volumes that persist independently from the life of the instance. 
- Amazon EBS is recommended when data must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence.
- EBS volumes are particularly well-suited for use as the primary storage for OS, Applications systems & databases.

## Root vs Additional Volumes
- Every EC2 instance must have a root volume, but Additional Volume is Optional.
- By default, EBS "root" volumes are set to be deleted when the instance is terminated. However, you can choose to have EBS volumes persist after termination.
- You can add additional EBS volumes to instance if needed.
- Any additional volume can be attached or detached from instance at any time.
