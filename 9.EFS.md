## Elastic File System
- EFS is a storage option for EC2 that allows for a scalable storage option.
- EFS can scale to petabytes in size,
- You pay only for the amount of storage you are using.
- Using EFS we can directly get the data across Multiple Availability Zones.
- Using EFS we can connect to multiple instances at the same time.
- EFS uses port 2049 for NFS file system, not for instances.
- We cannot use EFS as a root volume.
- To access EFS file system in VPC, you can create one or more mount targets in the VPC.
- AWS recommends that you create mount targets in all the AZ's, as there are no charges for mount targets.
